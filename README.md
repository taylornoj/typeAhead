# Type Ahead App
The Type Ahead app allows users to search for a city or state in America in an autocomplete dropdown.  To the right of the city and state is the corresponding city population.

My app can be found here: https://taylornoj.github.io/typeAhead/

## What I learned:
- I have already worked with fetch() and promises before however this extra practice was helpful
- The use of RegExp (using a variable as a matched string)

## Stretch Feature:
- When deleting the input after a search, the dropdown list returns to it's original state
